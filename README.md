# Rakpart

Quay for documentation test Docker images. The Test the Docs project creates opinionated defaults based on our experiences, but we are aware that everyone has different requirements. Each folder has a DockerFile, other files it needs, and you can find further documentation [here](https://pedantic-ritchie-166766.netlify.com/).
