TODO: Warn me about this 

One of the complexities with comparing Docker Hosting options is that many are offering management and orchestration tools on top of actual hosting providers. Not all make it clear which provider they use, when or where, and this may or may not be an important issue to you. For this reason I haven't included services such as Deis Workflow, The Docker Cloud or Container Ship as despite being great services, they don't claim to be, or offer integrated hosting services.
Whilst I will include services that host elsewhere, these costs are included in the price.

If you need Kubernetes for managing and orchestrating your containers, then Quay has a partner service called [Tectonic](https://tectonic.com/). As Quay and Tectonic are built by the CoreOS team, you can also use them to host and manage rkt containers, in fact Tectonic only works with rkt containers, but I thought I would sneak a mention in.

I thought I would sneak a mention in.

This also caused an "unknown error", or 'unknown error', If you can get Bluemix to work then it has powerful integration options available with IBM's IoT and machine learning offerings, but it's not for the inexperienced.
