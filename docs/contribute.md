# Contributing

## Abstract

Thank you for your interest in contributing to *Rakpart*.
This guide details how to contribute to *Rakpart* in a way that is easy for everyone.

We want to make it as easy as possible to become contribute, so we’ve created this guide to help you get started. We have multiple tracks to cater to people of varying experience levels.

If you’re uncomfortable getting into open source development right away, you may want to consider the Documentation, testing or giving feedback.

All of these Documentation are as important as code, and we'd be happy to have your contributions.

We want to create a welcoming environment for everyone who is interested in contributing.
Please visit our [Code of Conduct page](link.io) to learn more about our commitment to an open and welcoming environment.
